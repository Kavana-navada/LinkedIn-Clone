# LinkedIn Clone
Welcome to LinkedIn Clone, a frontend-only professional networking application built using React, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, Redux and LocalStorage.  

This project is designed to replicate LinkedIn’s core features, such as:  
- Viewing the posts.
- Adding comments.
- Like posts.
- Realtime update likes.
- Managing user profiles.  
- Exploring job listings.
- Saving jobs  
- Connecting with other users.  

Everything is handled on the frontend—there’s no backend, but we use LocalStorage to persist data like likes, saved jobs, and connections.
